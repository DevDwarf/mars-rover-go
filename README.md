# GoLang Application - Mars Rover
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository contains a GoLang application that demonstrates the use of SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion) and DDD (Domain-Driven Design) principles in some cases.

Some of the SOLID principles are not applicable to GoLang, but the application follows the principles as much as possible. Same for the DDD Architecture
